# Rust Interpreter for Crab

Crab is a fictional language based on the Monkey language that Thorsten Ball covers in this [book](https://interpreterbook.com). Here it is a fully working program written in Crab:
```js
let x = 10;
let y = 15;
let add = fn(a, b) {
return a + b;
};
let result = add(x, y);
```
As you can see is a pretty simple language, with only two statements: **let** and **return**, the rest of the language consists only of **expressions**.

``` 
    _~^~^~_
\) /  o o  \ (/
  '_   u   _'
  \ '-----' /
```
